Homeworks for Data Engineering 1 from Andras Bognar.

Analyzing Database for Rural town population in the USA.

The database is from data.gov. Link:

https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/atlas-of-rural-and-small-town-america

The relational database studies the rural counties in 5 tables:

1. 'Income' shows the economic situation of the population
2. 'People' shows the demographic characteristics of the counties
3. 'Jobs' show the characteristics of the job market of the counties
4. 'CntyClass' groups the counties based on economic-social categories
5. 'Veteran' shows the situation of veterans in each county

The 5 tables are stored in Rural_Atlas_Update23.zip that can be downloaded from above link.
The zip file also contains a master excel file for overview of all tables and explanation of each column.
In the GitHub Repository the zip file is not uploaded, file was added to .gitignore due to large size.
So far I only worked on the data in the 'Income' table within MySQL Workbench.
Therefore, for now only this file is uploaded.
