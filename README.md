Homeworks for Data Engineering 1 from Andras Bognar
Analyzing Database for Rural town population in the USA
The database is from data.gov Link:
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/atlas-of-rural-and-small-town-america
The relational database studies the rural counties in 5 tables:
1. Income shows the economic situation of the population
2. People shows the demographic characteristics of the counties
3. Jobs show the characteristics of the job market of the counties
4. CntyClass groups the counties based on economic-social categories
5. Veteran shows the situation of veterans in each county

The 5 tables are stored in Rural_Atlas_Update23.zip
It also contains a master excel file for overview.
So far I only loaded the data in Income to MySQL Workbench
