# **Term Project 1. - A. BOGNAR: Peaks Project**

Using the [Himalayan Climbing](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-22/readme.md) dataset of the [Tidy Tuesdays](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project, I aim to answer basic questions about the history of climbing the greatest mountain of the world while showcasing the data workflow steps learned during the course.


To start go to the [Documentation PDF File](https://github.com/BognarAndras/DE1/blob/main/Term_Project_1/code/Documentation.pdf) and download it (as links can't be opened from browser).
